            <p>As a beginner computer science student, creating a personal blog from scratch can take quite a bit of effort. So, as a freshman just coming to grips with the college and university scene, why did I decide to start blogging? </p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>The idea of blogging first came into my mind the summer before I would begin my college education. This was also when the COVID-19 pandemic was (and, I suppose, it still is) in its zenith, and with nothing to do, I began thinking about ways to fill my time, and one idea instantly came into my mind: writing.</p>
<p>However, I wanted to find ways to incorporate writing into what I thought would be my two main scholarly pursuits in college: mathematics and computer science–as of 2020-2024, I am currently pursuing a double major in Applied Mathematics with a cluster in Data Science and Computer Science. I also wanted to be able to use this opportunity to develop my woefully inadequate coding abilities. So, the idea of writing a blog and integrating it into a personal website was instantly attractive. I would write about anything that would pop into my mind, along with ideas in computer science and mathematics that I thought were worth mentioning and sharing. The personal website, I hoped, would be a useful tool in the future and allow me to showcase my resume and computer science projects.</p>
<p>But why write at all? As a double major, I am typically swamped in a plethora of coursework, and I intend on engaging in a number of extracurricular activities in the future. My rationale is three-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Writing is a very useful skill to have as an adult.</strong> Regardless of your profession, it is essential to be able to communicate ideas effectively, whether you are applying for a research position or engaging in a job interview. The ability to write concisely and to effectively connect with your reader is extremely important. This will be doubly important in my case, since I managed to test out of my college’s reading and comprehension requirement and will not be taking any R1A or R1B courses.</li>
<li><strong>Writing about topics in mathematics and computer science is would help reinforce the material I learn in college.</strong> Given the quick pace of most college classes, it is difficult to effectively retain knowledge once the semester ends. My hope is that, through constantly blogging and writing, that I will gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for my coursework. It is also extremely enjoyable to write blogs on what I am passionate about and to share that passion with an online community.</li>
<li>This is probably the most important reason. Given the paradigm of isolation and anxiety in the COVID-19 era, and the fact that college is completely online, <strong>writing is an integral component to maintaining mental health.</strong> I’m going to be honest, I experienced my fair share of anxiety this summer, what with my two technical summer classes, and I really do miss being with my friends. Currently, I’m living an isolation, a series of wildfires are gripping most of California, and thousands are dying each day from the pandemic. But, the ability to write and put things into context and hash everything out in print definitely helps to abate some of the nervousness and tension.</li>
</ol>
<p>Developing this website has also quickly introduced me to the intricacies of front-end web development. I pretty much grasped the basics of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, static-site generation, and Git within the space of a week (although my CSS is still a few hundred lines of incomprehensible spaghetti-code). I’m hoping to add some further interactivity into this website through jQuery and JavaScript.</p>
